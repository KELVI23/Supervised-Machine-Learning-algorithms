# Predict-Drug-Response
## Objective
Develop a classification model using Decision Tree Algorithm from the historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then use the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

### About the dataset
Medical reaseach data that has been collected from a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y.

The objective is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The features of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and the Cholesterol of the patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
